# Graph-Neural-Networks
> Collect recent learning materials about GNNs, cutting-edge trends, etc. weekly update from the Graph Machine Learning channel in [Telegram](https://t.me/graphML) or other platforms.â€‹ :sun_with_face: :running:

### **April 22** 
**Can graph neural networks understand chemistry?** 
- A talk by Dominique Beaini on their recent work and the [maze analogy](https://twitter.com/dom_beaini/status/1499019741234704385) for graph representation learning. 

- Main content: Covering papers on Principle Neighbourhood Aggregation, Directional GNNs, and Graph Transformers, this talk touches several sub-areas of recent advances in GNN architectures - WL testing and expressivity, positional encodings, anisotropy, spectral techniques, fully connected message passing, etc.
